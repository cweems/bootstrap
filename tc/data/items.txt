Recognized as a fast-growing and largely sustainable raw material, there is an increasing global demand for bamboo as a wood substitute for a variety of construction and furnishing applications.  However, bamboo resources are often poorly managed. Most engaged in the industry have limited knowledge of modern value-added processing techniques, which limit their earning potential.  As such, there is an opportunity to use new clean energy technologies in treating bamboo, so a broader market penetration can be achieved.</p>"

This deficiency in the distribution chain results in less than half of the milk produced reaching dairy processors. Of the milk that is processed, up to 30% of it may spoil without appropriate cold-storage options.  Consequently, many dairy farmers and processors unnecessarily may lose significant earning potential from their operations. Of the milk that does arrive, much of it has a high bacterial count due to lack of refrigeration, and this results in poor quality dairy products. Farmers can receive a premium price for providing higher quality, refrigerated milk to dairy processors. Dairy processors can also charge a premium for better quality and tasting dairy products if the milk can be chilled from farm to factory.</p>"
